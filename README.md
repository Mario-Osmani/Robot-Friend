Key Features:

Head: Watch the robot's head grow, rotate, and even change eye colors as you hover over it. It's like the robot is expressing emotions right in front of your eyes.

Torso: The robot's torso features two exciting movements. The right arm rotates clockwise, while the left arm rotates counterclockwise. Keep an eye on the vibrant color changes in the arms as they spin.

Right Arm and Left Arm: The right arm and left arm offer their twists to the robot's delightful dance. The right arm rotates clockwise and shifts colors, while the left arm rotates counterclockwise, adding to the overall charm.

Lower Body: The robot's lower body doesn't shy away from the fun. The left leg rotates clockwise, while the right leg rotates counterclockwise, creating an amusing balancing act.
